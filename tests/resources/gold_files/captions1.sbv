0:00:06.519,0:00:12.620
we can extract from a data frame by

0:00:09.560,0:00:16.250
speaker we can extract by vowel and we

0:00:12.620,0:00:18.669
can combine those conditions and the

0:00:16.250,0:00:20.990
magic here is the ampersand operator

0:00:18.669,0:00:24.529
that's what we're going to use to

0:00:20.990,0:00:28.999
combine conditions so let's just do it

0:00:24.529,0:00:31.339
one by one again I start by loading D

0:00:28.999,0:00:35.450
plier using the library command and then

0:00:31.339,0:00:37.190
first I'm going to define a vector that

0:00:35.450,0:00:40.520
contains the vowels that I want to

0:00:37.190,0:00:43.820
extract let's say trap and kit and then

0:00:40.520,0:00:46.010
I define a vector that contains the

0:00:43.820,0:00:48.260
names of the speakers that I want to

0:00:46.010,0:00:50.480
extract this could be used to define a

0:00:48.260,0:00:53.210
group of four people for example if you

0:00:50.480,0:00:57.620
have a larger data set I only have Allen

0:00:53.210,0:01:02.090
Erma I'll use them both here because why

0:00:57.620,0:01:04.730
not okay and then I'm going to make a

0:01:02.090,0:01:07.550
new data frame that is a subset of my

0:01:04.730,0:01:10.760
master norm I'm going to call it new

0:01:07.550,0:01:14.320
data and I'm going to use the filter

0:01:10.760,0:01:17.810
command to filter out of master norm

0:01:14.320,0:01:22.180
filter out of master norm comma and now

0:01:17.810,0:01:27.110
the conditions the vowel needs to be

0:01:22.180,0:01:29.030
percent in percent the my vowels vector

0:01:27.110,0:01:31.580
so it needs to be a member of that

0:01:29.030,0:01:34.340
vector drop and KITT and now it combined

0:01:31.580,0:01:39.200
with the ampersand and the condition

0:01:34.340,0:01:43.159
speaker must be in the speaker's vector

0:01:39.200,0:01:45.790
which I just defined so and I want rows

0:01:43.159,0:01:49.729
that meet both of these conditions

0:01:45.790,0:01:53.869
either Al or Emma saying either a trap

0:01:49.729,0:01:56.479
or a KITT vowel now I just ran those

0:01:53.869,0:01:58.250
first three lines of code and now I'm

0:01:56.479,0:02:01.670
running the fourth line of code

0:01:58.250,0:02:05.479
separately and I'm gonna click on my new

0:02:01.670,0:02:08.740
data frame and it's gonna be shown in

0:02:05.479,0:02:11.569
the preview event window top left and

0:02:08.740,0:02:13.800
that's all I have is Emma and Al and

0:02:11.569,0:02:15.580
they're saying either KITT words

0:02:13.800,0:02:32.269
trap words

0:02:15.580,0:02:32.269
