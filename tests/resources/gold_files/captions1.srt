1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:12,620
we can extract from a data frame by

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,250
speaker we can extract by vowel and we

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,669
can combine those conditions and the

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,990
magic here is the ampersand operator

5
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:24,529
that's what we're going to use to

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,999
combine conditions so let's just do it

7
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:31,339
one by one again I start by loading D

8
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:35,450
plier using the library command and then

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:37,190
first I'm going to define a vector that

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,520
contains the vowels that I want to

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,820
extract let's say trap and kit and then

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,010
I define a vector that contains the

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,260
names of the speakers that I want to

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,480
extract this could be used to define a

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,210
group of four people for example if you

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,620
have a larger data set I only have Allen

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:02,090
Erma I'll use them both here because why

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,730
not okay and then I'm going to make a

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,550
new data frame that is a subset of my

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,760
master norm I'm going to call it new

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:14,320
data and I'm going to use the filter

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,810
command to filter out of master norm

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,180
filter out of master norm comma and now

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:27,110
the conditions the vowel needs to be

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:29,030
percent in percent the my vowels vector

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,580
so it needs to be a member of that

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,340
vector drop and KITT and now it combined

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,200
with the ampersand and the condition

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:43,159
speaker must be in the speaker's vector

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,790
which I just defined so and I want rows

31
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,729
that meet both of these conditions

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:53,869
either Al or Emma saying either a trap

33
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,479
or a KITT vowel now I just ran those

34
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,250
first three lines of code and now I'm

35
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,670
running the fourth line of code

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:05,479
separately and I'm gonna click on my new

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,740
data frame and it's gonna be shown in

38
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,569
the preview event window top left and

39
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,800
that's all I have is Emma and Al and

40
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,580
they're saying either KITT words

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:32,269
trap words

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:32,269
