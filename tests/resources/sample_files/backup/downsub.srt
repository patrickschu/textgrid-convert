1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
well I'd like to introduce you to our

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,740
keynote speaker this morning Katie Bell

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,649
come on up katie is not like not yet

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,540
katie is a former software developer for

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,480
google of many years look like a veteran

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,109
run there and left there recently to

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,900
join a sydney-based startup named grok

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,480
learning working with high schools

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,250
building a platform for programming in

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,340
education something like that I think I

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,850
tangled up a few half sentences there

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,200
but I will hand directly over to her so

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,510
that I won't keep mincing my words round

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,340
of applause for Katie Bell please okay

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,920
is Mike on good all right yes I'm Katie

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,450
I worked for a company called grok

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,270
learning and to kind of give you an

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,100
explanation of what we do a groc

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,469
learning i'm going to take you through

20
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,670
thinking like a non programmer

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,129
approaching programming in Python for

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,699
the very first time and the way our

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,010
platform works is we have essentially an

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,360
online system it teaches you everything

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,400
you need to know about to pipe them in

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,439
order to do a series of challenge

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,360
questions those challenge questions

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,640
start off extraordinarily easy with

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,619
hello world and similar kinds of

30
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,840
variations before we move on to the

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,299
first kind of scary complicated question

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,650
where you're supposed to write a name

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,530
that right in it write a program that

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,430
asks the user what is your name and the

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,229
user then types in something and it

36
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,900
should say hello to the user with

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,790
whatever name they use a typed in who

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,020
thinks they could write this program

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,310
okay good stuff um ok so we're going to

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,470
go through the sort of series of thought

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,890
processes that are one of our students

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,040
Hamish started with so this is the first

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,770
attempt so the system works as you write

44
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,829
in your attempt at this program and then

45
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,659
you can hit you can run it yourself you

46
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,310
can see that it works the way you expect

47
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,659
it to work and then you can hit a mark

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,850
button that runs it through a series of

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,890
tests to give you feedback and help you

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,630
point help point you in the right to

51
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,720
for eventually getting the question

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,890
correct so hey measure in this case

53
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,600
copied exactly one of the examples from

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,700
the notes that had been reading through

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,010
which is good the student actually read

56
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,640
the notes um it's a good start but that

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,220
doesn't really answer the question your

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,840
program doesn't really work it says

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,390
hello and 10 and it's meant to say what

60
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,560
is your name so next attempt getting

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,170
much closer it's even like reading in

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,300
the input into a variable printing it

63
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,570
out that's pretty good but it's still

64
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,690
not exactly right and we emphasize this

65
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,190
right from the beginning in our course

66
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,420
that you must be very precise and we'll

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,940
get to that in a sec okay this time

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,040
we've got the space after the question

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,910
mark that's a good step um all right now

70
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,510
it's even sort of yeah not not quite

71
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,280
getting what's what's going on here but

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,900
you know it's printing out some extra

73
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,370
stuff yeah a report I wish is getting a

74
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,720
little bit confused and we're learning

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,820
from this Hamish is learning firstly

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,650
that computers are stupid the computers

77
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,330
not gonna understand what it means when

78
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,540
he says I'm hema Sh um when that

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,550
computers require precision is learning

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,650
to put spaces in the right places

81
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,330
learning that the output needs to be

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,590
exact okay so we go through um we have

83
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,110
another couple more attempts I up is

84
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,790
getting close it's just just got the

85
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,130
space wrong there okay oh and now it

86
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,580
fails the second test case um so it

87
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,350
works perfectly well as long as you type

88
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,780
in that your name is Brock and it

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,100
doesn't work at all if you type in

90
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,620
anything else and so all right so the

91
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,090
program is meant to print further now

92
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,080
okay

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,520
oh but now it's meant to print rock ah

94
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,260
this goes on for some time we miss Feld

95
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,960
further back to Brock again and then

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,720
eventually we get there um this is kind

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,380
of demonstrating how someone who has

98
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,630
never understood how a computer works

99
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,510
how programming works approaching it for

100
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,280
the first time is sort of learning

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,500
firstly the computers are stupid that

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,050
there but they also have to respond to

103
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,420
different kinds of input when I type in

104
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,770
something different the program has a

105
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,990
series of rules which it then responds

106
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,210
to and that's kind of the fundamental

107
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,640
piece of how programming works here's

108
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,890
another questions or getting rid of the

109
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,480
the sort of user interface around that

110
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,670
this is the question this is the answer

111
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,880
that we expect okay it's moving on this

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,190
is sort of after week one you've gotten

113
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,210
through multiple things you've learned

114
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,740
if statements you've learned while loops

115
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,690
you won learned for loops we're starting

116
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,360
to put them all together this is sort of

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,370
five weeks later in our course so this

118
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,020
is a much more complicated example we're

119
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,900
reading in one line of input at a time

120
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,850
appending it to a list reversing the

121
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,530
list and then printing it out in reverse

122
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,930
order this is my favorite attempt for

123
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,310
one of these questions it starts out

124
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,100
fine go to a while loop it's adding it

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,750
in for some reason it's also counting

126
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,130
how many things that's adding to the

127
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,919
while loop why is that because this is

128
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,560
how we're printing it out um so as part

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,380
of learning to program computer students

130
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,510
are also going to learn that they should

131
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,860
be avoiding unnecessary repetition

132
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,720
because eventually this doesn't work

133
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
this is what computers are good at the

134
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,330
good at repeating things over and over

135
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,940
again so that you don't have to I tried

136
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,650
to find an example of a student getting

137
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,229
mixed up about different data types

138
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,669
because this is one of the things that

139
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,560
really really killed students when

140
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,660
they're starting out with Python and

141
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,300
this was the best one I came up with

142
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,590
she's kind of got that there's something

143
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,600
wrong with trying to like add and

144
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
subtract strings but hasn't quite worked

145
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,240
out that they're already strings and

146
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,710
that string of firing them is not

147
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,990
actually going to help

148
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,360
but yeah this is a question one of the

149
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,970
students asked on the forum so is out of

150
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,009
learning that the data has the structure

151
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,960
to it in computing like a string is

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,880
fundamentally a different thing to an

153
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,550
integer and so on and as we learn lists

154
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,810
there are more complicated structures

155
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,930
and stuff so why are we teaching coding

156
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,180
who has heard this before coding is the

157
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,210
new literacy yeah some of you it's also

158
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,830
a complete crap um kind of I I get

159
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,449
really annoyed when people share this

160
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:42,979
kind of coating is a new literacy

161
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,569
everyone is going to need to be able to

162
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,130
code or you won't be able to get a job

163
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,470
um that sounds like a really terrible

164
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,430
plan to me um I don't want to have every

165
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,990
person in the world coding that's going

166
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,639
to end up with a lot of crappy and

167
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,740
redundant code and but what do we when

168
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,449
we're talking about how everyone should

169
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,120
learn to code why is it that we actually

170
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,159
want everyone to learn to code we

171
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,409
definitely don't want everyone to be

172
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,389
programmers we need a lot of people to

173
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,430
do other things as well and again we

174
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,259
don't want everyone writing copy code we

175
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,789
should be able to write the code once

176
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,039
and then it should be used multiple

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,690
times we shouldn't have everyone running

178
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,270
code so I propose that we change this

179
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,580
instead of talking about coding is the

180
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,979
new literacy should make hurting is the

181
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,909
new biology and before you like what the

182
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,520
hell let me explain that a little bit so

183
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,440
when you study biology at school firstly

184
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,780
you start studying it in primary school

185
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,310
you start with really simple things you

186
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,800
grow little broad beans or heads of

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
grass and stuff and you see that plants

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,090
need water and plants need sunlight and

189
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,490
as you get older you start to understand

190
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,800
that a lot more you learn about

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,810
photosynthesis you learn ah this is why

192
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,210
if we don't give any it plant any

193
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,949
sunlight it's going to die we don't give

194
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,419
it water adults are not going to survive

195
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,650
very long it makes sense of the world

196
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,569
around you and then you can reason about

197
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,770
it you have part of being an intelligent

198
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,780
human being in society's understanding

199
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,940
how photosynthesis works how we get food

200
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,240
every day how we don't die in the same

201
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,250
way

202
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,539
understanding how a computer works is

203
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,180
fundamental to being able to use them

204
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,310
well to be able to being able to reason

205
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,169
about them in society to be able to make

206
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,470
intelligent decisions as a voter when

207
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,458
technical issues come up and things so

208
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,289
going back to what our students were

209
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,640
learning as they were starting to

210
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,490
program their learning that there are

211
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,049
limitations to what computers can do

212
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,050
they can only do follow a series of

213
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,730
rules based on the inputs that they're

214
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,430
given if you could imagine how much

215
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,899
easier tech support would be if every

216
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,020
single user understood this if you can

217
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,300
they understand that the purpose of

218
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,540
computers is to avoid work for humans if

219
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,040
you understand what a computer is

220
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,320
capable of doing you're able to sit back

221
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,870
and write wait a minute why am i doing a

222
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,180
job that could be replaced by a computer

223
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,620
you don't need to be a professional

224
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,320
coder to have enough understanding to be

225
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,330
able to see that so every sir I leave

226
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,820
every student should learn to procured

227
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,000
at school during school and this helps

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,339
not only like attract more programmers

229
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,080
to the field because more people will

230
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,000
become interested in programming this

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,430
also helps fields which are very likely

232
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,190
to need coders like finance and science

233
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,200
and engineering where if you study

234
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,880
physics these days you study physics at

235
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
school we study physics at University

236
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,490
and you start doing research and

237
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,959
discover that you need to be able to

238
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,200
code in order to do that research and

239
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,730
then you have a crash course in coding

240
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,959
and a lot of physicists with very

241
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,260
terrible code I'm learning that earlier

242
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,640
would then help those fields that do

243
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,980
actually require coding it also helps

244
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
every other field because people will be

245
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,510
able to see how computers fit in how

246
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,100
compare our programming fits in what

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,260
kind of tools they can use what is

248
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,950
available to them it also helps

249
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,990
inclusivity you end up the current

250
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,329
system where students will only learn to

251
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,010
code if for some reason they are

252
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,510
expecting that they will find it

253
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,550
interesting and they choose to then

254
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,290
learn about it if you start off with

255
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,060
every single child learning about it

256
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,829
that gives every single child the

257
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,810
opportunity to find out if it's

258
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,360
something that they're interested in so

259
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,300
this helps women this helps minority is

260
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,230
generally a good thing so let's give

261
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,470
this a little bit more structure we're

262
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,600
going to dive in to how this actually

263
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,660
looks at a school level when you're

264
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,350
teaching coding am and as two examples

265
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm going to look at the UK curriculum

266
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,480
and the new Australian Curriculum that's

267
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,760
coming out in the next couple of years

268
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,960
my understanding is that in New Zealand

269
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,940
at the moment the only curriculum for

270
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,180
coding is a an optional sort of high

271
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,360
later end of high school kind of thing

272
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,970
there's nothing for earlier on so this

273
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,110
is a fairly high level summary of the UK

274
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,050
code in curriculum and this came out in

275
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,400
the last couple of years and they've

276
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,290
started teaching it already a lot of

277
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,310
teachers are freaking out because they

278
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,860
don't know how to teach programming cuz

279
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,610
they don't know how to program

280
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,280
themselves but they're working on it so

281
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,260
notice that this starts really really

282
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,440
young at the top Key Stage one five and

283
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,350
six-year-olds starting to think about

284
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,710
algorithms and computational thinking so

285
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,880
this doesn't mean that we're getting

286
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,740
five year olds to start coding and

287
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,180
Python because they can sort of barely

288
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,890
read yet but we are starting to get five

289
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,780
and six-year-olds to think about things

290
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,000
in a computational thinking kind of way

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,810
how do I explain in a structured way how

292
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,580
to make toast in the morning what are

293
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,560
the decisions I make you can start to

294
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,030
think about branching decisions when he

295
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,980
thinks if it is raining then I should

296
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,750
take an umbrella otherwise I should

297
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,800
bring a hat we can start discussing

298
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,810
those things and developing those

299
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,430
algorithms in series of steps and

300
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,220
instructions and you'll also start to

301
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,010
talk about using technology and kind of

302
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,290
what it means when you're creating data

303
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,360
so creating storing retrieving digital

304
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,220
data could be very simple like taking a

305
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,040
photo and saving it to a hard drive

306
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,930
somewhere and then sending it to someone

307
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,140
else when you get to the sort of vs 7 to

308
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,830
11 year olds age group that's when they

309
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,480
start actually writing programs and in

310
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,040
the UK this is usually done with

311
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,080
something like scratch okay visual

312
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
programming language where they're

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,270
starting to write

314
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,980
programs would they actually have to

315
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,570
think okay I want the program to do this

316
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,620
they come up with a series of

317
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,600
instructions and steps you introduce

318
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,310
variables introduce branching they are

319
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,990
starting to learn that there's also

320
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,350
things in there about how networks and

321
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,870
the internet work how computers fit into

322
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,160
the daily lives there's also stuff

323
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,950
throughout the curriculum on using the

324
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,080
internet safely and using the impacts of

325
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,850
technology on society and sort of fuzzy

326
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,660
things like that as well um the key part

327
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,550
getting into the older kids which is

328
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,400
sort of 11 to 14 they have to learn two

329
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,650
different programming languages and at

330
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,790
least one of them has to be a text based

331
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,250
programming language and in the UK this

332
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,280
is almost always Python it is incredibly

333
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
common to be teaching Python in schools

334
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
in the UK at the moment there's also

335
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,740
particular things in the curriculum

336
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,380
about learning boolean logic and an or

337
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,410
operators how hardware and software how

338
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,240
computers work that they have a series

339
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,770
of instructions that they are executing

340
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,750
one by one and that data is represented

341
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,770
in binary moving on to the Australian

342
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,050
Curriculum this is the structure um

343
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,960
there is a much like again these are

344
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,940
very very like condensed versions of the

345
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,320
curriculum there's a lot of text in

346
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
there the Australian Curriculum is

347
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,600
divided into separate sort of course

348
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,280
streams these are only two of them there

349
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,130
is a couple more but starting in after

350
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,020
two which in the New Zealand system

351
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,900
would be 12 grade 1 2 3 again starting

352
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,220
describing algorithm starting to

353
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,610
identify the digital systems that you're

354
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,380
using every day starting to the really

355
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,940
basic things that you can do in a

356
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,660
classroom with a teacher and just paper

357
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,040
and white boards and stuff not even

358
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,060
touching a computer at this point the

359
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,860
the Australian Curriculum has a little

360
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,570
bit more detail in it than the UK

361
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,890
curriculum and it goes into more detail

362
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,620
specifically about how data is stored

363
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,570
and represented in numbers and in binary

364
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,480
and how getting onto the later ones our

365
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,570
text and images and sound data is

366
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,170
represented in binary but the

367
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,270
progression for programming is very

368
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,490
similar to the UK system where you start

369
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,350
out again

370
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,350
very young kids describing algorithms

371
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,910
then for the sort of primary school aged

372
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,860
kids you're using a visual programming

373
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,890
language starting off with input and

374
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,180
doing if statements and then getting to

375
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,790
more complicated things like loops but

376
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,430
again in year 7 and 8 which in the New

377
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,720
Zealand system would be your 89 you

378
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,610
learn a general-purpose programming

379
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,110
language and again the curriculum is

380
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,980
very language neutral um but you can see

381
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,660
how I think could fit in there so

382
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,840
talking about Python are you know some

383
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,660
of our students all right um why would

384
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,000
we teach Python in schools as opposed to

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,910
any other language and I really enjoy

386
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,070
teaching python python is definitely a

387
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,660
good language for teaching and it's

388
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,370
essentially good for the same reasons

389
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,460
that you guys all like python is because

390
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,860
it is very clean and simple especially

391
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,140
when you get started if you imagine this

392
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,270
program in java when you have glasses

393
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,650
and stuff there's a hell of a lot of

394
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,870
stuff that you have to explain away or

395
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,600
ignore as you're getting started and

396
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,210
you're in your first programs the other

397
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,650
thing i particularly like about python

398
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,420
is demonstrated by this example so i can

399
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,330
anyone see the problem with this i mean

400
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,770
the first problem is that it's in python

401
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,460
to never ever teach python sure and this

402
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,970
is probably my favorite reason why you

403
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,330
can see the bug with this yes okay you

404
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,990
will hit this before um yes for is

405
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,280
bigger than a thousand whoa album yep

406
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,800
for anyone that hasn't noticed the num

407
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
variable here is a string and in Python

408
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,210
too you can compare a string to a number

409
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,980
and it just kind of works except it only

410
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,200
works if it happens to the number

411
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,790
happens to be you greater than the

412
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,870
number that you wanted it to be greater

413
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,410
than in Python 30 so much better um I

414
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,600
cannot like describe to you how many

415
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
times I have seen students bashing their

416
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,230
heads against the wall for like why does

417
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,240
my if statement work only if the number

418
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,350
is less than the other number um this is

419
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,730
much better and this is what i like

420
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,980
about python particularly python 3 never

421
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,069
ever teach presenter

422
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,500
is because it had a lot of thought put

423
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,409
into it to make it clean and consistent

424
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,439
and nice arm if you've tried teaching

425
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,939
JavaScript and there's lots of random

426
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,909
little gotchas in there i think is much

427
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,409
nicer this makes it a particularly good

428
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:20,699
teaching language again for the same

429
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,400
reason that you guys curd in Python and

430
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,099
so as mentioned before this is really

431
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,199
where it fits in nicely in the UK

432
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,450
curriculum and again this is where it

433
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,730
fits in nicely with the Australian

434
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,130
Curriculum as well New Zealand is

435
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,900
usually a little bit ahead of Australia

436
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,380
and everything um but I you guys need a

437
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,970
code in curriculum ok this is the

438
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,400
problem with Python we're teaching

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Python what is this idle here is years

440
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,650
the idol ide at some point in time ok

441
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,630
who actually uses it for anything useful

442
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,600
no nobody because did anyone here work

443
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,650
on idle at all ok good i can like and

444
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,990
safely i can safely just idle is really

445
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,870
annoying and it not only looks like crap

446
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,059
it's also it also it looks even works on

447
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,659
a mac um it's kind of painful to use in

448
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,860
the interpreter you can't even use the

449
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,000
up arrow to get back to your previous

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,990
commands but if you go into schools and

451
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,340
you see them teaching python this is

452
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,020
almost always what they're using and

453
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,590
it's kind of terrible at groc learning

454
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,780
we decided to put everything online so

455
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,820
we built our own we think else is better

456
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,070
and nicer but it does have the

457
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,500
disadvantage that it is online you can't

458
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,230
necessarily do pygame apps with it for

459
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,970
example because all of the Python is

460
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,230
running on our servers and you can't

461
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,530
really get a UI um so if you're doing

462
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,280
stuff locally idol is the kind of choice

463
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
and that's not particularly great but

464
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,549
there are a lot of really really cool

465
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,970
things that people are using Python for

466
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,370
and teaching with Python so I want to go

467
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,360
through a couple of those because

468
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,919
they're they're really cool examples of

469
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,350
what you can do so the raspberry pi

470
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,570
foundation has a lot of activities that

471
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,620
use Python are with the Raspberry Pi

472
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,000
this one is one of the examples where

473
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,429
you hook up a little tiny camera and a

474
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,430
button and Cody

475
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,470
only in Python you can write the code

476
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,090
that if you hit the button then it will

477
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,340
take a photo and it will store it and

478
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,690
you can use this to make little stop

479
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,960
motion videos and kids seem to love this

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,090
essentially you can do electronics

481
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,980
programming with Python which is pretty

482
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,470
awesome and so that's a really good way

483
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,880
to get kids doing something hands on

484
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,120
something that's interactive you there

485
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,170
is a Python API for Minecraft which lets

486
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,450
you place blocks and softness is also

487
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,850
really cool and engaging for kids this

488
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,800
is usually designed to run on the

489
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,690
Raspberry Pi but this can also run on

490
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,400
the regular Minecraft version as well

491
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,390
one of the things that we launched

492
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,370
recently at groc learning is using

493
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,670
turtle graphics or logo depending on

494
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,810
what generation you come from what you

495
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,620
call it and this is one for very very

496
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,000
beginning programming stuff where you

497
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,800
can actually sort of see the result SI

498
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,420
moving the total and it's turning left

499
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,160
and right and you can draw pretty

500
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,170
pictures and stuff with it which is cool

501
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,340
as well and there's always pie game

502
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,050
which always seems to end up looking

503
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,230
something like this but it is very

504
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,940
exciting for kids to have like stuff to

505
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,110
draw on the screen and stuff the

506
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,790
downside of Pi game is that there is a

507
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,730
lot that you have to cover to even get

508
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,040
started and doing anything is kind of a

509
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,960
little bit painful like yes okay I need

510
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,610
to work out the coordinates and all this

511
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,930
image on the screen and this exact

512
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,210
wouldn't it it could be a bit nicer but

513
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,150
it is very very cool and engaging so

514
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,080
this is um and explanation that I give

515
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,070
to people a lot when they're talking

516
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,540
about our but we should do this to get

517
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,400
kids excited turns out different kids

518
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,310
get excited about different things and

519
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,140
so when teaching programming there these

520
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,760
are the three different kind of major

521
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,980
areas that I see kids get excited about

522
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,080
when they're learning to code some kids

523
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,910
get excited purely about the algorithmic

524
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,610
problem solving steps where they don't

525
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,230
really care what the code is actually

526
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,760
doing as long as they're like enjoying

527
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,920
the thought process of I have to do this

528
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,570
thing and now how do i formulate that

529
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,800
incurred to make it through the thing

530
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,960
that I want some kids get excited

531
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,360
learning how computers actually work

532
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,790
learning what is going on and sort of

533
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,450
building things at the very low level

534
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,510
tens of gravitating more to the

535
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,730
electronics and robotics kind of stuff

536
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,470
and then there's kind of the the

537
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,019
building cool stuff I kids who they

538
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,909
don't kind of care like what the process

539
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,440
is to get there but they want something

540
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
that they can really show off at the end

541
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,210
and this is kind of the the difficult

542
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,100
part for Python so apart from all of the

543
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,480
cool stuff that I showed you that you

544
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,309
can teach with Python the problem with

545
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,730
all of those is that they are very much

546
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,700
toys they are not real world python

547
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,139
applications and this works really

548
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,389
really well for the younger primary

549
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,740
school-aged kids but when they're

550
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,950
getting older we need something to then

551
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,320
bring that back together and sure hey

552
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,029
you just learned a real-world skill that

553
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:07,370
can build the kinds of software that you

554
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,700
use yourself every day so they want to

555
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,360
learn like hey this is a kill that I

556
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,830
could use to build something that will

557
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,230
actually genuinely be useful in my life

558
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,000
that people might actually want to use I

559
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,250
could be a product or something so my

560
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,889
question to you is where is your Python

561
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:26,480
running sorry if you guys are all Python

562
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,850
developers put your hand up if your code

563
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,240
is running in some way that is useful to

564
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,260
a person other than you cool so your

565
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,789
code is running somewhere it's in it's

566
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,320
in production it's its launch to the

567
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,350
user okay so for your hand up again if

568
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,779
your code is not running on your own

569
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,080
servers somewhere okay is it actually

570
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,860
running on a desktop device or a mobile

571
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,529
device a couple of you that's actually

572
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:57,380
more than I expected um that is

573
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,169
interesting um essentially my experience

574
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,779
most of what Python developers do is run

575
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,909
on Linux servers somewhere in the cloud

576
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,620
somewhere as some kind of web server

577
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,529
like this um and it's very hard to find

578
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:16,070
ways to use Python to develop the kinds

579
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,649
of apps and tools that the kids actually

580
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,860
know as the ones that they're using so

581
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,260
they the kids know I have this app that

582
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,480
I install on my foreign or there's a

583
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,309
software that I can run on my computer

584
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,500
as a game or something like that these

585
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,299
are the sort of tangible software pieces

586
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,100
that they're familiar

587
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,260
and if they could build those they could

588
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,610
really see the value of what they're

589
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,299
doing the way we've gotten around this

590
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,270
in the past is by getting kids to use

591
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,419
Python to build a web server to build a

592
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,520
website which is interactive and they

593
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,190
and they can take things into forms and

594
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,200
then it stores but the downside of this

595
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,500
is that is actually a really huge

596
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,210
project to get anything working if you

597
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,150
want a kid to be able to write a Python

598
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,010
web server they need to understand HTML

599
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,169
I need to understand CSS if it wants to

600
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,539
look not like crap they need to

601
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,970
understand how HTTP works and you need

602
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,559
some kind of database for storing stuff

603
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,150
in so usually that would be some kind of

604
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,130
SQL database and so you're suddenly

605
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,350
teaching for different kinds of writing

606
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,960
like you know I HTML CSS Python and SQL

607
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,330
in order just to get something working

608
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,470
that looks like a website that was made

609
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,799
10 years ago now because there's no

610
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,020
JavaScript if you want JavaScript you

611
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,990
have to learn yet another language um so

612
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,270
we do this and I have seen this work in

613
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,919
schools where you have a particularly

614
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,210
motivated teacher that actually

615
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,380
understands all of these different

616
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,570
things themselves and can guide the

617
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,429
students through that um but this is

618
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,200
mostly the time completely infeasible

619
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:01,360
for schools so we are so this is kind of

620
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,429
my my challenge to you guys um is we

621
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:08,350
have kids and we have teachers coming to

622
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,020
us and saying I want to build an app can

623
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,260
I do that with Python it's like well it

624
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,080
kind of made me you could um but we want

625
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
kids that I want to build a game and

626
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,840
then I just want to be able to send that

627
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,669
to my friends and then they can run it

628
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,140
and play it and I was like well I guess

629
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,640
you could package it up and um and I'll

630
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,900
let you guess which one of these comes

631
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,309
from a teacher when we're teaching

632
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:36,580
Python um the teachers are like yes

633
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,809
they're getting into it and they're

634
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:39,309
really excited but like we need

635
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,390
something that

636
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,090
is visually engaging that then they can

637
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,430
they can build interactive things and

638
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,350
stuff and this is this is generally a

639
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,000
bit hard in Python so this is my

640
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,450
challenge to you firstly replace idle

641
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,710
and make a better idea because that

642
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,630
would be awesome some kind of simple and

643
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,760
powerful graphical interface toolkit

644
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,500
where I can just kind of draw a button

645
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,780
and then write very very simple code so

646
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,980
i can click that button then something

647
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,070
happens that would be awesome to make

648
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,740
python work on mobile there are some

649
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,570
projects already underway for this which

650
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,790
look really cool so I'm excited about

651
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,160
that but at the moment I would not

652
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,670
recommend writing yeah um and one thing

653
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,690
that I thought would be particularly

654
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,840
cool coming from New Zealand is that I

655
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,400
understand that python is the scripting

656
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,410
language for pretty much all 3d

657
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,210
animation stuff but I've never seen

658
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,270
anyone make this work in a classroom

659
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,310
where you have a bunch of kids like that

660
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,700
would be a very cool very interactive

661
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,430
real-world application of Python but I

662
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,510
have not seen anyone do this so if

663
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,800
anyone's working in the 3d animation

664
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,330
industry talk to me afterwards that

665
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,050
would be very cool and the teachers will

666
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,870
thank you we have we had like in you

667
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,760
know i grok learning we have contact

668
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,770
with a lot of different teachers and

669
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,540
then we get the feedback yes we are

670
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,920
loving learning python the kids are

671
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,780
getting really into it what can we do

672
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,230
next um so any kind of stuff from that

673
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,870
would begin apart from that we really

674
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,990
need advocates advocates for teaching

675
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,810
coding in schools and not only that even

676
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,940
if we do get coding taught in schools in

677
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,650
order to get a generation of kids that

678
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,060
actually understand computers coming

679
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,030
through the teachers are going to need a

680
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,000
lot of help so anything that you guys

681
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,090
can do to help train teachers to learn

682
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,640
to program to program and to teach

683
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,590
programming is going to be really

684
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,920
valuable I tend to try and shy away from

685
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,770
coding clubs where the kids are choosing

686
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,300
to go and be there because you're

687
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,280
usually only getting the kids that are

688
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,870
already interested in learning to code

689
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,640
and can maybe do it in their spare time

690
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,710
or their parents are computer scientists

691
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,960
or something but running a workshop in

692
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,430
the school where you're taking a whole

693
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,300
class

694
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,440
is much more valuable because then

695
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,520
there's a whole ton of kids that never

696
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,140
would have understood programming at all

697
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,060
before that who are then getting

698
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,610
exposure to it or become a teacher so

699
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,320
coders who then become teachers also

700
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,370
very cool because then you'll actually

701
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,650
have coding skills in the classroom as

702
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,740
well ah so that's cool that's me doc I

703
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,880
think I might have talked a little bit

704
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,790
too fast but there's lots of time

705
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:22,270
questions cool let's open up for

706
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,890
questions I'll run right and bring the

707
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,510
mic to you so someone raised their hands

708
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,190
Brenda hi I love what you're doing and I

709
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,050
really want to do this stuff too but how

710
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,730
do you fund all this here I have a day

711
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,770
job I don't have a time how do you do

712
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,670
this that is a good question um so the

713
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,370
sort of group that this started with I

714
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,930
was the national computer science school

715
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,000
so this is the National in the in

716
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,590
Australia um run by Sydney University

717
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,270
from the one of the academics a couple

718
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,770
of the academics there and they've been

719
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,600
running a summer camp teaching Python

720
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,310
well not originally teaching by thing

721
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,950
because it started 20 years ago but for

722
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,720
the last 16 years teaching Python at

723
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,360
this summer camp unfortunately the

724
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,620
summer camp has the same problem as

725
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,730
every other coding club you are only

726
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,020
reaching the couple of students that

727
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,040
elected to come there and so the Sir

728
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,170
James Cowan one of the academics in the

729
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,300
university started an online Python

730
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,010
programming competition which also

731
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,320
teaches Python in order to reach a lot

732
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,360
more kids and that was starting to reach

733
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,890
the order of 10,000 kids every year

734
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,230
wanted to expand this more but wasn't

735
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,700
getting enough backing from the

736
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,240
University and so this is why grok

737
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,860
learning started as a separate company

738
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,160
so grok learning is a tiny for-profit

739
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,820
company where we charge twenty dollars

740
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,220
per student to learn Python online and

741
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,720
that is where the money comes from the

742
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,419
sort of small amounts of it yes

743
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:54,590
um ah thank you for your presentation my

744
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,989
question is up I went to my children's

745
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:59,210
school and told the principal that i

746
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,340
would like to run a linux a workshop at

747
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,009
some stage and the principal told me

748
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,989
that she has to go to some Department of

749
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:07,489
Education get the permission and this

750
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:10,999
all red tape blocked my proposal at that

751
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,340
time and she never came back to me so my

752
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,289
question to you is that for the local

753
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,269
you may have run already some workshops

754
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:19,399
in the school how do you approach and

755
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,109
can you be with them put some more light

756
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:23,509
on to it please how do you a virgin um

757
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,129
so I'm not entirely sure what the

758
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:27,080
problems were in that case but there are

759
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,789
certain processes that you need to go

760
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,220
through to have a background check and

761
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:38,629
stuff done to be okay um apart on that

762
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,369
oh you really would need is a permission

763
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,200
of the school i'm not sure what else the

764
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:50,289
school would need for that okay um so

765
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,179
sorry so I work in the school's this

766
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:55,220
admin but you know the school that I'm

767
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,499
working is that I used to study and so

768
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:00,169
and basically can say that my teacher

769
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:01,519
kind of pushed me into programming in

770
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,379
this is one I'm stead of handling this

771
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:07,940
you know then you guys but I found this

772
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,309
a lot of like you know i'm bout teach it

773
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,379
does a lot of you know a lot of effort

774
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,239
into teaching as programming and after

775
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,590
I've been in uni I found that a lot of

776
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,349
kids don't even learn half what we

777
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:20,859
learned in our yes in our program and

778
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,090
it's very hard to encourage teachers to

779
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,799
learn new stuff such as I'm trying to

780
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,989
encourage the our teacher to learn get

781
00:31:26,989 --> 00:31:29,059
because I'm sick of looking six versions

782
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,440
of the same pitch because it's just

783
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,960
horrible so how do you encourage

784
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,899
teachers to to learn program how to

785
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,609
encourage them to stop learning how to

786
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,349
do a freaking PowerPoint presentations

787
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,239
and look at something interesting those

788
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,499
kids are suffering from the fact that

789
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,820
teachers don't want to do anything about

790
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,669
that fact oh yes so that is unfortunate

791
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,099
right there's there's not a lot that you

792
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,979
can do to make it make someone learn

793
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,149
something new when do something in a

794
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:54,200
different way to what they were doing it

795
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,519
before and that goes for every year

796
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,580
every kind of in

797
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,799
not just teachers like getting out of

798
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,029
the pattern of that what you were in

799
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:02,929
before this is a big problem because

800
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:05,070
we're coding in particular because you

801
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,330
get some kids that have been coding

802
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,649
since they were eight years old and

803
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:09,269
they've like already they get to

804
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,440
university and they're like why are we

805
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,590
learning java or you know java and you

806
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,090
get other kids that have no idea what

807
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,019
programming is because they've never

808
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,049
seen it before and you have this huge

809
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,019
disparity yes this is exactly the kind

810
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,760
of problem that having a set curriculum

811
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,710
across all schools is designed to solve

812
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,200
yours essentially define this is the

813
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,510
minimum standard that we expect students

814
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,269
to achieve at school and this is the

815
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:34,710
purpose of curriculum this is I don't

816
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,600
see any way to actually get coding

817
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,250
taught in schools without it being part

818
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,039
of the mandated curriculum you can

819
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,409
encourage and you can sort of prod as

820
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:44,970
much as you want and say don't worry you

821
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,080
don't have to teach it I can come to

822
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,659
your school and then teach a Dora

823
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,399
something like that but ultimately

824
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,019
you're never going to get this in every

825
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,559
school everywhere unless it is enforced

826
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:01,130
yeah yes yeah my question to you is a

827
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,190
you said that we need a better idea but

828
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,880
what is the use case often ide what but

829
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,580
when I learn Python I found it much more

830
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,100
useful to just use a good edit text

831
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,970
editor and Python maybe ipython as a

832
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,730
shell to toy around with but I never

833
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,519
needed something more than a decent text

834
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,250
editor how so that is that is an

835
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,010
interesting point as in I've seen this

836
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,570
occasionally where a student becomes a

837
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,429
lot more engaged when they use the

838
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,659
command line then when they using

839
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:37,080
somekind of prepackaged ID but

840
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,700
ultimately it's it's less scary when

841
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,559
you're first starting out if you have

842
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,120
sort of air all the information that you

843
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,820
need in one place kids are typically bad

844
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,490
at typing they're bad at switching

845
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,500
between different windows and managing

846
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,419
all the kind of muscle memory tabbing

847
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,559
between different windows and stuff

848
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,120
isn't something that you have in primary

849
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,820
school and so even idle where you have

850
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,590
two different windows where you have a

851
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,269
different window for your text editor in

852
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:04,789
a different window for your interpreter

853
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,219
gets really confusing for kids and I've

854
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,739
seen this

855
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,139
and having some kind of platform where

856
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,969
you have here's my card and here is the

857
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,440
code running and I can see both at the

858
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,710
same time as useful and it will show you

859
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,570
highlight a particular line when you've

860
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,429
got a syntax error or something like

861
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,010
that so I think there is a lot of value

862
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,409
in having an ID in making those initial

863
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,629
steps to get into programming much

864
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:30,129
easier there is only one thing that you

865
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:32,110
have to download install you don't also

866
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,260
have to learn how to use a command line

867
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:43,239
in order to be able to program in I just

868
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,639
following up on your point about how in

869
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,600
Python 2 with the input for the number

870
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,889
and the fact that if you don't convert

871
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,989
it to a number then you get a program

872
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,730
that runs but just does completely the

873
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,780
wrong thing yeah sorry versus Python 3

874
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,940
which runs but then crashes with a

875
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,520
useful error message yeah my question is

876
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,130
why not use a language that just doesn't

877
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,369
give you a program at all and just gives

878
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:12,250
you a useful type error instead and note

879
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,530
that I am very much not implying that

880
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,480
you use Java for that what do you mean

881
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,220
that gives you a useful type error as an

882
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,930
how is that different to work what

883
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,490
Python does well yeah I mean yeah I mean

884
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,290
Haskell or or or a language like that

885
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,010
and I mean it's more I'm well yeah I

886
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,690
resent the fact that you implied that we

887
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,670
all like Python here I consider it the

888
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,369
best I consider it the best of a bad

889
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:45,420
bunch and I'm firmly in the canister

890
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,440
programming languages but I hate fight

891
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,580
and slightly less than a lot of the

892
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,530
other ones yes yeah so um you know I

893
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,510
don't think dynamically typed languages

894
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,850
are the right languages for people to be

895
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,619
using and therefore I don't think that

896
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,750
they're the right languages I know I

897
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,430
will admit this as well um Python would

898
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,500
be a hell of a lot easier to teach if we

899
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,540
declared the types when we declared the

900
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,240
variables if there if it was statically

901
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,320
typed that way because explaining that

902
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,090
this variable is an end and this

903
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,790
variable is a string and that you

904
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,700
add them together is much easier when

905
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,710
each variable has int or strain written

906
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,670
next to it now you can but the kids

907
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,260
aren't going to do that um so yes I

908
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,120
agree that having the sort of type

909
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,260
definitions would make it easier to

910
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,510
teach I have not found a language that

911
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:51,080
is better to teach them Python door okay

912
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:05,470
I was just thinking about your idea of

913
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,529
an IDE better than I'd all but you know

914
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,259
a lot of ideas for Python I think would

915
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:13,480
probably be way overpowered for the club

916
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,759
audience you're discussing almost always

917
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:17,349
the one that comes up is Piton the

918
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:18,490
Community Edition because it's free

919
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,730
right um pai tom is like eclipse for

920
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,970
Python um it is very cool if you're I

921
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,589
guess has lots of cool features and

922
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:29,019
stuff but it is incredibly like just way

923
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,730
too many buttons way too many controls

924
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:37,589
it is very confusing for kids aspect

925
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,789
would i look would like an event okay um

926
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:44,740
it has to have syntax highlighting it

927
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,450
has to tell you what error like which

928
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,700
line the errors are on you have to be

929
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,559
able to run it in the same window so

930
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,849
that you can see here is my code and

931
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,480
here is my code running um at a minimum

932
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,490
that would be that would be it and it

933
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,069
has to be not painful to use let's go

934
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,559
with that but very clean very simple um

935
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,470
i highly recommend if you've ever seen

936
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,970
gosh or to last name Carrie Ann from the

937
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,980
raspberry pi foundation I gave a really

938
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,450
great keynote at euro python last year

939
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,480
and also at PyCon Australia this year oh

940
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,700
no both of them is with this year um and

941
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,230
what a large part of what she talked

942
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,549
about was hear all of the different

943
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,079
things that people use of Python IVs and

944
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,509
why they all suck um this is what I want

945
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,549
in an IDE so talk to her she has a lot

946
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:31,869
of opinions on this and they are good

947
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,890
opinions yes okay okay yes thanks very

948
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,900
much for you talk by the way the the

949
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,160
Twittersphere education people are

950
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,079
already I'm frothing at the mouth for

951
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,440
the video of this talk because they okay

952
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,339
so they're already looking at groc

953
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,599
learning calm and all that sort of thing

954
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,239
so that's good I was just wondering with

955
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,230
regard to the teaching of teachers in

956
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,539
this very room a few years ago I was

957
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,739
first introduced to something called

958
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,329
software carpentry I don't know if

959
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,069
anybody hears come across that but it's

960
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:02,319
a Canadian run effort but it's an

961
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,109
international and international program

962
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:09,349
designed to teach primarily scientists

963
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,630
how to make better use of computing so

964
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,049
that they can amplify their research

965
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:16,400
capabilities and also do things properly

966
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,920
rather than as you pointed out writing a

967
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,279
whole lot of code badly and they the

968
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,950
software carpentry trains people to

969
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,700
become bootcamp teachers so they get

970
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,859
people into a three day boot camp where

971
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,390
they learn the command line other on

972
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,249
Linux are on a Mac because Windows

973
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,220
doesn't do it and they have they learned

974
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,410
then immediately get and then they learn

975
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,960
ipython by popping notebooks which

976
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,089
actually I think to certain extent will

977
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,799
address some of the IDE questions that

978
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:50,539
you also ask potentially yeah okay

979
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,039
anyway I realize it's a bit more ground

980
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,499
yeah sledgehammer for a brass tack but

981
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:56,960
anyway yeah so it would be interesting

982
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,880
to see whether you guys could perhaps

983
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,999
join forces with software carpentry to

984
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,190
instruct teachers because the curriculum

985
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,109
materials are all in github they're all

986
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:07,549
open they're all creative commons

987
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:10,460
licensed and otherwise open source cool

988
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,930
that's a really good idea I think I have

989
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,119
met someone from software copy beautiful

990
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,430
um but yeah we hadn't discussed like

991
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,710
collaborating on that sir yes I have

992
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,660
another question about typing and

993
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,769
functional programming and that kind of

994
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:30,619
stuff I totally agree that item is

995
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:35,660
probably the best language to teach but

996
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,979
if we have plans to teach kids more than

997
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:44,089
one language do you know if there's been

998
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:45,950
some thought about what other language

999
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,279
and in my opinion it should be a highly

1000
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:53,329
s antonius functional programming

1001
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,589
language like the opposite of piety I

1002
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:00,349
can see how that you know 10 15 years

1003
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:02,779
from now wants everyone it once teaches

1004
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:04,700
a comfortable teaching one paradigm of

1005
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,829
programming that maybe we would it would

1006
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:08,930
be cool to also teach a functional

1007
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,460
language in schools as well and maybe

1008
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,410
next time we update the curriculum in 20

1009
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,680
years it will be

1010
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,089
learning one language isn't enough we

1011
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,349
should also learn a functional language

1012
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,660
I don't think that is feasible at this

1013
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,720
time but it is a very interesting idea

1014
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,359
and if there was a teacher that was very

1015
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,530
keen to be teaching that that would be

1016
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,700
that would be completely supported by

1017
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,410
the curriculum its language independent

1018
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,099
I would like to go back to my favorite

1019
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,880
diagram this one where the functional

1020
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,220
paradigm as a sort of problem solving

1021
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,930
and way of thinking will be fascinating

1022
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,730
force the kids that love the problem

1023
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,030
solving an algorithms side the it does

1024
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,010
not necessarily help you so much with

1025
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,780
building cool stuff that then you can

1026
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,520
show off to your friends and so it'd be

1027
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,619
a little bit hesitant about teaching or

1028
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,359
only that but if it was in conjunction

1029
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,619
with another language as well that would

1030
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,460
be cool yeah so in terms of number of

1031
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,230
languages required to deal with web apps

1032
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,130
maybe pop a genius oh I have not seen

1033
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,670
this before or this that sounds kind of

1034
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:24,869
scary to be honest it is um okay just

1035
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:26,640
putting it out there but I remember

1036
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,339
vividly in high school when we were

1037
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,059
doing physics they told us that atoms

1038
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,890
were made up of this big ball of

1039
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,109
something which was called Nicholas and

1040
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:40,460
it had currents no no that there were

1041
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,200
electrons which looked like currents or

1042
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,170
possibly raisins inside and then the

1043
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,970
next year they said forget everything we

1044
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,799
told you last year was a lie they're

1045
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,540
actually like the Sol system than their

1046
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,790
their whizzing around and then I believe

1047
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,319
if I kept going to university they were

1048
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:57,660
safe forget everything you got told it

1049
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,549
was all the conservation of mass and

1050
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:01,200
then later on it's like well really

1051
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,490
conservation of mass is conservation of

1052
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,150
energy isn't so the question is well

1053
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,140
it's not a quick now i'm going to say

1054
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,359
stay down i'm sure that that applies to

1055
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,569
teaching kids programming that you may

1056
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:14,190
want to teach them functional but that's

1057
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,290
kind of maybe the third year lie you

1058
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,540
should start with the really simple lie

1059
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,579
and say hey pythons gonna give you

1060
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,380
everything you need no it's not like

1061
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,339
you're going to need the function

1062
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,960
actually we lied you're going to need a

1063
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
sink in the future

1064
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,780
yeah yeah as long as kids are learning

1065
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,550
the sort of fundamental I have this

1066
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,960
problem and I break it down into a

1067
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,460
series of steps that then the computer

1068
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,950
can understand oh that is a huge step

1069
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,050
and that will get them a big advantage

1070
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,940
later on as I go to university and then

1071
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:56,310
study actual programming yes hey yeah

1072
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,990
schools often interested in examining

1073
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,540
what the students have done and I found

1074
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,880
when I went to school that the

1075
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,609
examination er wasn't really that great

1076
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:09,730
but i really enjoy things like a google

1077
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,710
code jam where you actually get problems

1078
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,420
that are interesting and you have to

1079
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,150
solve them in a certain time so things

1080
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,790
like that might be good to look into if

1081
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,339
you're running against the wall off how

1082
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,880
do we examine this oh yeah that is that

1083
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,369
is an interesting question a lot of

1084
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:30,220
exams a stool at school will be done on

1085
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,599
paper so if a school was learning a

1086
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,040
particular programming language they are

1087
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,410
likely to be doing exams in that

1088
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,570
programming language as for the the sort

1089
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,490
of cross school exams if there are any

1090
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,080
in the future the way this is done at

1091
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,450
the moment in a language-independent way

1092
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,690
is by doing pseudocode algorithms in the

1093
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,910
exam but yes I agree would absolutely

1094
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,040
absolutely be much better to have sort

1095
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,980
of online timed exams where you write

1096
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,630
code and you can actually run the code

1097
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,470
before submitting it

1098
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:16,250
okay so there's no call record involved

1099
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:22,220
in the exam yeah okay hi there just I

1100
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,260
like that diagram you have the air too

1101
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,750
because it is actually doing things one

1102
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,010
of the things I think the people in this

1103
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,750
room because we've both in programmers

1104
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,029
or programmers of any description is

1105
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,400
we've already actually pulled ourselves

1106
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,019
into one particular spot in the complete

1107
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,630
set of types of ways of thinking about

1108
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:47,559
problems and things and so do you go

1109
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,680
talking to your two teachers to staff to

1110
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,000
treachery try and find you know

1111
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,220
different angles and ways of doing it

1112
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,579
how are you getting good feedback Aug

1113
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:03,380
communicating well with the teaching

1114
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,230
sort of industry generally yes so

1115
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,930
through running out online courses we

1116
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,289
have essentially a set of forums where

1117
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:14,599
the kids can ask questions and so we get

1118
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,579
very very immediate feedback on what the

1119
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:17,869
kids are understanding and what they're

1120
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,369
not understanding based on the questions

1121
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:21,859
that we're getting in the forms and you

1122
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:23,599
we answer them we help them through and

1123
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,039
we can find better ways of explaining

1124
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,900
things to different kids as we go

1125
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,339
through we also get a lot of feedback

1126
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:31,160
from teachers on what they like and what

1127
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,660
they don't like we've had teachers been

1128
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,950
who've been using our system for five or

1129
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,779
six years now and we get and they're if

1130
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:42,859
there's anything that they don't like

1131
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,980
simply find out very quickly um and we

1132
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,390
get a lot of feedback on them from them

1133
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,119
how to improve it sir yeah there's a lot

1134
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,049
of a lot of communication there let's

1135
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:58,190
hope this is on it works a very basic

1136
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,640
question of how many students are using

1137
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,509
your system roughly at the moment and

1138
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:08,289
not so basic what kind of demographics

1139
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:15,349
other it's probably best explained oh I

1140
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:16,650
don't have internet on it moment

1141
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,630
okay um so our big thing of the year is

1142
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,539
this competition that we run which is

1143
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:27,359
just in its final week now and that gets

1144
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:35,369
about 10,000 students and the age groups

1145
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,460
range quite significantly so the what I

1146
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,930
wanted to show you is that we have four

1147
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,010
different levels of difficulty um and if

1148
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,359
I turn the internet on this is it then

1149
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,279
so we have what we call newbies

1150
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:52,760
beginners intermediate and advanced and

1151
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:59,160
newbies uh okay that's fine I'll just

1152
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,829
use my roaming well that is not remain

1153
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:10,430
it's a local sim um there we go okay so

1154
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,650
we have a new breeze beginners

1155
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,270
intermediate and advanced or four

1156
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,099
different levels of difficulty newbies

1157
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,829
is usually primary school kids but we

1158
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,049
have kids up to like so you're sort of

1159
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,980
grades four five and six um and the way

1160
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,660
actually it's not a good example of a

1161
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:35,890
question let's go back okay

1162
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,170
it's also not a good example that's true

1163
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:44,740
I see one of the later ones sure okay so

1164
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:51,250
this is actually a set of blocks that

1165
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,599
click together that then generate Python

1166
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,849
um so this is what we start the

1167
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:00,369
beginners on when they're in the sort of

1168
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,230
primary school age and this scroll bar

1169
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,779
isn't working very well okay um so you

1170
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:07,980
have for example the first line is

1171
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,960
assigning to a variable with some input

1172
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,789
and that generates the Python directly

1173
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,680
there so as you're you're changing the

1174
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,539
blocks and you're sort of doing stuff

1175
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:20,880
around that kind of thing um it is

1176
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,869
editing the Python right in front of you

1177
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:24,549
we find this is a good way to transition

1178
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:27,130
kids into actually doing Python so we

1179
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,140
don't start Python directly necessarily

1180
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,369
with a sort of year five and six kids

1181
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,230
but that is where we start the other

1182
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,549
ones are just plain writing Python

1183
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:38,859
beginners starts out with just Heller

1184
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:42,839
world input and goes up to lists and

1185
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,039
intermediate starts at the beginning of

1186
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,259
all goes a bit faster advanced is quite

1187
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:49,359
advanced and does some interesting

1188
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:54,450
computer science there we do have a huge

1189
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:00,250
range of abilities visually we have

1190
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,230
different levels and so the wii range

1191
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,839
all the way from grade 5 to grade 12 or

1192
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,369
grade 6 to grade 13 in the new zealand

1193
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:13,619
grade system yep hey oh yeah

1194
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,190
um we do get schools across the board

1195
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,830
but we do tend to two it does tend to

1196
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,350
balance more to the higher end schools

1197
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,470
the like wealthy schools and the the

1198
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,820
more selective schools yeah yeah kind of

1199
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,410
a follow up question about demographics

1200
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,620
dizzam gras cloning have any ambitions

1201
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,350
to cross the ditch or run the National

1202
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,650
Computer Science advances this challenge

1203
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,540
is open to new zealand students it's all

1204
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,830
online so there's nothing really

1205
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,150
stopping anyone in the world from

1206
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,460
participating in it and we do get a

1207
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,690
whole bunch of kids from new zealand and

1208
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,920
we have quite a few schools from New

1209
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,110
Zealand as well participating and do you

1210
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,400
have quite a few people just doing the

1211
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,490
courses not through the challenge fun

1212
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,590
yes less so sorry the channel the the

1213
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,270
competition with its very structured

1214
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,780
time frame works well as a motivator

1215
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,640
like here is here is the deadline you

1216
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,720
have to start the course now here for

1217
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,950
the finish the course now you get a lot

1218
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,210
more people that way than just having a

1219
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,830
course that's open all the time but

1220
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,150
people say hey this is cool last out

1221
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,550
later and then never do so we do have

1222
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,990
courses that are available all the time

1223
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,300
as well introduction programming and

1224
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,400
HTML and CSS course and stuff but most

1225
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,120
of what we get is the competitions yeah

1226
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,810
we have time for one more question

1227
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,220
just from the list of tests that I saw

1228
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,869
you were doing on the input and from the

1229
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:56,599
kind of mistakes you said people made it

1230
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:58,490
seemed like a lot of that kind of thing

1231
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,650
is just what would be picked up on by

1232
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,380
people using auto-completion obviously

1233
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,000
like people in this room would argue

1234
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,529
that's a crutch I wonder like what's

1235
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:07,759
your opinion on that like do you think

1236
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:10,130
that's an important feature to have and

1237
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,599
like have you had a chance to do any

1238
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,559
testing on students for whether it helps

1239
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,759
no I haven't done any testing on that

1240
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,440
and that would be interesting to find

1241
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,170
out that is one of the big differences

1242
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,509
between the blocks and coding in Python

1243
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:28,640
yourself because the blocks are all here

1244
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,279
and you can look them up and find the

1245
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:32,720
block that you need and then just put it

1246
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,059
in rather than having to remember how to

1247
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,990
type everything but the blocks obviously

1248
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,390
get annoying to use and having we

1249
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,740
haven't done any experiments with

1250
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,720
autocomplete to see if that would help

1251
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,130
because we don't have an order complete

1252
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,160
system built into our site that would be

1253
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,039
an interesting experiment to run and I

1254
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:53,930
don't know what the outcome would be I

1255
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,880
suspect that you would get a lot of kids

1256
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,579
if you can rely on alter order complete

1257
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,450
in the early problems then if they're

1258
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,980
not fully understanding the concepts

1261
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,559
later that could be a real problem um

1260
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:08,210
but again it could also just avoid kids

1261
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,009
getting stuck and throwing their hands

1262
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:13,819
up in frustration and giving up sir cool

1263
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,410
please join me one one more time and

1264
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,549
thinking Katie Bell for her

1265
00:53:18,950 --> 00:00:00,000
you
