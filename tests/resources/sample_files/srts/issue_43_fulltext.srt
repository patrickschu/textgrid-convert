1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,405
Now, we can start talking about your

2
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:10,805
family's story during the genocide.

3
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:14,805
My ancestors, my grandpa and grandma

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:21,665
in 1915, my mom's side was from Marash

5
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:25,735
and my dad's side was from Boursa.

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,435
My mother and father were born and raised

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,477
in Aleppo.

8
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:33,787
Like them, I was born in the

9
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:35,907
same city.

10
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:39,287
I went to school in that city. My entire

11
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:42,497
childhood was spent there.

12
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:45,495
I went to school in Aleppo and had a good

13
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,355
environment. I have also been

14
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:50,985
an Armenian language teacher.

15
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,782
I have left all my friends in Aleppo

16
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:56,982
and came to Yerevan.

17
00:00:56,982 --> 00:01:00,795
Do you know how your grandparents came

18
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,633
to Turkey and to Syria?

19
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:06,683
It is not really clear how my family

20
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,052
from Marash came...

21
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,792
In 1915, they must have joined the other

22
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:13,462
Armenians that fled the country and went

23
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:15,627
to an orphanage in Aleppo.

24
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:19,607
In that orphanage, they introduced them

25
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:25,397
to my grandmother and grandfather.

26
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,776
And then, they got married.

27
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,947
On my dad's side, the same

28
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:32,597
thing happened. They were also raised

29
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:34,253
in an orphanage.

30
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:38,643
My grandparents met one another there

31
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,303
and got married.

32
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:47,423
Do you know what they did for work?

33
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:51,423
I do not know where they used to work

34
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,823
during that time.

35
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:58,953
On my dad's side, they owned some land

36
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,118
and agricultural properties.

37
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:04,977
On my mom's side, it is a bit harder

38
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:07,344
to know. My family goes back many

39
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,529
generations and it's hard to know

40
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,129
where they worked.

41
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,649
My grandpa was a mechanic.

42
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,440
What else should I say?

43
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:25,114
Do you know how hard it was to start

44
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:29,834
their life again in Aleppo after the war?

45
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,384
What difficulties did they face?

46
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:35,154
Yes, they did go through tough times

47
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,088
during the war.

48
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,953
Firstly, they have lived in metal

49
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,454
shacks. They are called metal shacks

50
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,444
for Armenians. In Arabic, they say

51
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,574
berakatl Armen.

52
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:52,434
Secondly, the Armenians missed having

53
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,074
a home and moved into their own houses.

54
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,077
Life started to improve and as soon as we

55
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:03,337
came to Aleppo or Syria in general...

56
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,827
we had some Armenian churches.

57
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:08,287
Next to the churches, we had Armenian

58
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,477
schools. In the beginning, we have had

59
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,777
year-around schools. The population were

60
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,657
all Turkish speakers.

61
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:17,728
Since it was mandatory, they spoke Turkish

62
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,328
for 500 years.

63
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,648
When they came to Aleppo, due to the

64
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:24,328
Armenian schools they attended, the

65
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:26,938
people became more and more Armenian.

66
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,573
They started teaching Armenian.

67
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,148
From generation to generation,

68
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,048
we feel more Armenian since we speak

69
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:34,198
Armenian and have Armenian schools.

70
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:36,555
We also have Armenian

71
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,078
at the secondary level.

72
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,851
In Aleppo, what do you do to remember

73
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,191
the 1915 genocide and April 24th?

74
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,376
On the morning of April 24th, we go to

75
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:54,876
the cemetery and gather around the chapel

76
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:57,806
to remember those that we lost by praying

77
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,776
and by lighting candles.

78
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:02,554
During that time and on some days,

79
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:06,254
lectures took place in the Armenian

80
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:09,094
community centers.

81
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,068
From generation to generation,

82
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:15,698
we continue to remember and to not forget

83
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,962
that we have a problem with keeping

84
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,112
our Armenianhood. It is not only about

85
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,292
April 24th. It is not about tears.

86
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,542
Armenians do get sad and emotional

87
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,542
about what happened to our people.

88
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:31,312
We have been reborn and are

89
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:35,892
still living. We are still here. They said

90
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,812
that they are going to kill every

91
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:42,412
Armenian and leave one. They are going to

92
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,462
put that person in a museum. They did not

93
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:49,212
succeed in doing that. Because of that,

94
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:52,402
April 24th is a time of sorrow

95
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:56,092
for us. At the same time, it is

96
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,882
a victory for the Armenian people.

97
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,842
We are still present. We are still here.

98
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,752
We still have demands and want restitution

99
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,702
from them. We are not sleeping.

100
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:07,872
We are awake.

101
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,382
From generation to generation, we teach

102
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:13,072
them Armenian heritage and spirit with

103
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,852
the help of our cultural organizations.

104
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,999
With that, we prepare the next

105
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,679
generation of Armenians.

106
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,762
That is great.

107
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:23,672
Tell me a bit about your childhood.

108
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:26,352
My childhood... I was really happy.

109
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:29,482
Where were you raised? Aleppo! Aleppo!

110
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:31,882
I was born in Aleppo. In which neighborhood?

111
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:35,052
Sulaymaniyah! I was born in Aleppo

112
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,538
and grew up there in the same house.

113
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,638
My house is still luckily there.

114
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:44,928
I had a good childhood and was very happy.

115
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,098
I always had a good life... always.

116
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,098
Which school did you attend?

117
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:56,568
I went to Lazar Najarian. I attended that

118
00:05:56,568 --> 00:06:01,378
school. I graduated in 1984. In terms of

119
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:04,868
the different community centers, I do not

120
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:10,388
want to make a distinction between them.

121
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:14,038
All of the community centers do their work

122
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,898
in their own way and follow different

123
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,718
principles. The goal that they all share

124
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:21,368
is Armenians keeping their

125
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:23,698
Armenianhood in the Diaspora.

126
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,187
We used to go to the theater with my

127
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,517
family. We did not have the choice to

128
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:33,907
go to one and not the other.

129
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:37,087
May it be a theater performance or

130
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:41,667
a literary evening, we have attended most

131
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,567
of them. I have been part of the scouting

132
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:49,217
ranks for a few years (for a short time).

133
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,827
It was one of the most beautiful years

134
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,707
of my life.

135
00:06:57,197 --> 00:07:00,877
Until when did you go to school?

136
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,287
I graduated with the 1984 class.

137
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,897
High school

138
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:06,467
After you said...

139
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,847
After that, I studied Armenian Studies .

140
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:12,957
In university?
-Hamazkayin had opened

141
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:16,827
their own Armenian Studies department.

142
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,587
A very long time ago, I went to

143
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:22,157
the British Council.

144
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,187
What kind of work did you do?

145
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:31,127
I have been an Armenian language teacher.

146
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:34,467
And... when you were an Armenian teacher,

147
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,017
did you think that it was

148
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:40,197
your responsibility to teach them

149
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:43,787
the language and about their culture?

150
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,207
Yes, it is important to know about

151
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:49,117
their culture. To teach Armenians the

152
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,527
Armenian language is a big responsibility

153
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,397
in the Diaspora.

154
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:56,977
Our teaching is not limited to learning

155
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,717
how to read and write and studying grammar

156
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,457
and literature. It is also to teach them

157
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,917
Armenian values by introducing

158
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,117
the students to Armenian symbols in order to

159
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:11,027
make them feel a sense of belonging

160
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,337
to the Armenian culture.

161
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:15,337
If someone asks them

162
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,867
about who they are

163
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,447
they would say Armenian.

164
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,617
"What does it mean to be an Armenian?"

165
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,727
They should be able to say that

166
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,809
Armenians are the group of people that

167
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,083
lived during the times of Dikran Medz

168
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,798
a long time ago. We have been a prominent

169
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:33,158
nation from sea to sea. We have had some

170
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,250
well-known Armenians like Viktor Ambartsumian

171
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
and Aram Khachaturian.

172
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,950
We have had many famous personalities.

173
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,540
It would be hard to count them all.

174
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,000
We should remember the individuals that

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,350
fought for our people and be proud of all

176
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,860
the things they have done for us.

177
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,450
We have to tell the new generation

178
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,810
about this. So, they hear and know

179
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,790
what is being an Armenian and feel

180
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,640
a sense of belongingness.

181
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,700
Only speaking Armenian is not enough.

182
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,960
And which school?

183
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,355
I was at Zvartnots Primary School.

184
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:16,145
And... do you think that the students

185
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:20,200
are interested in this subject matter?

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,230
The teacher is the person that should

187
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,070
make them interested in it.

188
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,322
They say that learning about literature

189
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,692
can be boring, but it is not like that.

190
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,172
The teacher can get them interested in our

191
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:36,112
culture, because our culture is very

192
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:39,432
beautiful. You can make it more

193
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:42,062
interesting for the students by making

194
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,952
them relate to the subject.

195
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,032
I did all the work. I do not know how much

196
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,732
I succeeded in that since I have only

197
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:53,692
worked for 10 years. Before that, I worked

198
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,322
with the English language...

199
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:59,542
not with Armenians.

200
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:04,182
When you were an Armenian teacher, did you

201
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,852
feel free in Syria to say anything in

202
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:12,892
school or about what the government allows

203
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,832
and what it does not?

204
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:20,092
We had permission for 4 hours per week

205
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:24,412
to teach the Armenian language

206
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:28,052
in Armenian schools and 2 hours

207
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,132
to teach religion.

208
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:34,482
We were free. We had Armenian language

209
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:37,482
and religion books.

210
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:40,242
We had no restrictions.

211
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,952
We have been very free.

212
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,432
We have also had our own printing press

213
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:47,342
and our newspapers and printed books

214
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:50,072
in Armenian. We would easily receive

215
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,572
permission to print from the Syrian

216
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,102
government. Until the time that we did not

217
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:57,762
make a mistake and say and/or write

218
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,002
something wrong about the government

219
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,722
or against religion, we could print

220
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:05,782
anything. It was a positive thing to be

221
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,142
an Armenian in Syria. As a minority,

222
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,822
we had many rights.

223
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:13,632
Everyone was equal. Everyone was equal.

224
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,752
The Arabs, the Armenians, the Assyrians,

225
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:19,532
and the Kurds, all had equal rights.

226
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:24,282
Unlike some other minorities, we had

227
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:27,292
schools, the printing press, theaters,

228
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:31,862
and scouting ranks. We had all the rights.

229
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,512
We were never treated differently

230
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:38,222
by the government... not by our last prime

231
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:41,912
minister and not by the current one.

232
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:45,732
Did you experience any difficulty?

233
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:48,862
I know you said that the government did

234
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,942
not cause any difficulty. Did the people?

235
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:55,592
The people? No, they were very respectful

236
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,902
in regards to us. The Arabs were very

237
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:02,202
respectful towards us. All of us have had

238
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,942
friendships. We all have had good

239
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,712
and honest friends. We have never been

240
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,512
told you are Armenian...

241
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,362
why do you live here?

242
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:13,972
You should go back to Armenia. They have

243
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,132
never said that. On the contrary,

244
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:21,182
they were happy with us. The Arab culture

245
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:24,712
has always shown respect to the Armenian people.

246
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:28,332
Do you see a difference between

247
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,212
Armenians and non-Armenians in terms

248
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:34,662
of how they were treated? A difference?

249
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:39,112
All Syrians are one. There could not be

250
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:42,022
any difference between them. As Syrians,

251
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:45,602
we were equal. We had not noticed any

252
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:49,422
difference. When there were religious

253
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:54,142
events, like Easter or other holidays,

254
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,502
we would celebrate them differently

255
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,922
than others since we were Christian.

256
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:05,062
In general! In general, we were one.

257
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,812
There was no difference

258
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,422
between us. On the contrary,

259
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,022
we would visit each other. They would

260
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,302
visit us during the holidays. We would

261
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:16,052
visit them and wish them happy holidays.

262
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:19,572
We have never felt any difference.

263
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:22,712
When you got older (apart from work),

264
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:25,982
what would you do in your life?

265
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:31,695
I had a strong social life. Strong social life!

266
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:36,005
I like having friends. I have gone to

267
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,785
a lot of places with my brother like

268
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,965
historical castles and other antiquities.

269
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,155
Syria is a rich country with its

270
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,675
historical sites. If you have heard of

271
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:50,495
the city of Palmyra, it is very known.

272
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,645
I visited a lot of ancient places in Syria with my brother.

273
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:55,665
Do you want

274
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,285
to explain anything from your life

275
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,915
before the war?

276
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,135
Before the war, I do not have anything

277
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,145
specific to talk about. I already said

278
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,135
everything. I talked about the type

279
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,575
of life we had... a good and happy life.

280
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:11,125
Difficulties! We cannot call it

281
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,205
difficulties. These are normal

282
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,815
difficulties that we have overcome

283
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:21,185
in life. Before the war, it was very good.

284
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,715
After the war, however, everything changed.

285
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:28,745
Before 2011, were there

286
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,305
any signs that a war was going to

287
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,125
start soon?

288
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:38,555
For the most part, there were signs.

289
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:42,355
Things happened. Some governments

290
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,825
threatened others.

291
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,425
Middle Eastern countries have

292
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,715
always been in danger. The worry about

293
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,445
a war starting has always been there.

294
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:56,195
But until the last minute, you cannot know

295
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,405
that for sure a war will take place.

296
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,815
Maybe, they will come to an agreement.

297
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,315
You will get convinced of that and will

298
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:06,695
always have hope that it will not happen.

299
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:11,035
When did you know the war in Syria

300
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,905
had started? What were the first signs?

301
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,975
In the beginning, it started at

302
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:20,495
the outskirts. We heard the sounds.

303
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,615
I visited Armenia for 2 months. I was

304
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:28,145
going to return to Aleppo. They came

305
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,185
and took over the city.

306
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,765
I stayed here for a while. A lot

307
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,685
of people came from Aleppo. They came

308
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:41,155
in 2012 in August and September. It was

309
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:45,325
during that time. I stayed here too. Then,

310
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:48,315
there were people that returned to Aleppo.

311
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,475
During New Year's Day, I returned too.

312
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:53,735
I stayed there for 6 months. Then, I went

313
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:58,705
back. In June 2013, I came back to

314
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:01,685
Armenia. I came back here.

315
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:06,175
When you traveled from Syria

316
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,625
to Armenia and from Armenia to Syria... how was it?

317
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,085
The first time, I came here on

318
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,775
an airplane and returned the same way.

319
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:18,535
The second time, I came with a car.

320
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:21,055
We came on our own. We passed

321
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:23,935
the Turkish border and went to Georgia

322
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:25,425
and after Armenia.

323
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,425
Any difficulties?

324
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,775
Of course, there were going to be some

325
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:31,055
difficulties. It was evident that we were

326
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,765
going to have some difficulties.

327
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,065
We left illegally. So, we were going

328
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:37,145
to face some difficulties.

329
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,385
The 6 months that you were in Syria...

330
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:43,135
Yes. What state was Aleppo in?

331
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,085
It was really bad. It was really bad.

332
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,895
There was no electricity.

333
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,650
There was no water.

334
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,505
Excuse me.

335
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,825
Yes, there was in the beginning.

336
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:52,985
After...

337
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:56,975
Always, there was the fear of death.

338
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,155
It was not the fear of death per se, but

339
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,675
the way that someone was going to die.

340
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,645
It was the violent depictions displayed

341
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:08,115
in videos and photos on YouTube.

342
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,525
More than death, you would worry about

343
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,565
the way you were going to die.

344
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,615
You always heard the people

345
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,255
and the sound of bombs.

346
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:18,175
At night, it would get worse.

347
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:20,855
In the morning, it would be less.

348
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:23,915
And why? I turned back,

349
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,315
because it was safer.

350
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,895
I came back to Armenia, because it was safer.

351
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:32,415
Why did you go back

352
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,115
to Armenia and then Syria?

353
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:40,515
I went to Syria. My brother was in Syria.

354
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:45,315
We were going to celebrate New Year's.

355
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,625
We had no one there. We did not want

356
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,335
my brother to be alone.

357
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,615
I am here. He is there.

358
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,395
I took the risk. I did not want to...

359
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,295
In this world, he only has me

360
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,485
and I only have him.

361
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,615
That is how I went there.

362
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,445
And then, we came here together.

363
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:09,115
And... are the other families still in Aleppo?

364
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:12,835
I do not have a mom and a dad.

365
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:16,025
Other family members? My mom and my dad

366
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:19,435
have already passed away. My brother...

367
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:22,665
Before the war?

368
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:26,555
My mom died before the war due to an illness.

369
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:30,785
My dad died long before that.

370
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:38,345
And... the first time you went to Armenia?

371
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,595
Was that the first time that you went to Armenia?

372
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:45,135
I came here in 2004 with other

373
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,735
teachers for training purposes

374
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,675
for 1 month. I was in love with Armenia.

375
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,175
I had left my soul here. I wanted to

376
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,175
live in Armenia. We had decided with

377
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,175
the family to live here. My brother would

378
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:06,175
come when he had breaks.

379
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,845
He would say that we should live here

380
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,135
and go back later. We said that it is

381
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,545
hard. We already have good jobs

382
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,085
back home.

383
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,325
And yes, we came.

384
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,015
Did you come in 2012?

385
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,515
The last time was in 2013.

386
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,435
But the first time in 2012? Yes, 2012.

387
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:30,735
The first first time was in 2004. 2004!

388
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,965
The second one was in 2012.

389
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:36,905
How was your new life? How did you feel

390
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,205
in Armenia? How was life there?

391
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,055
What were the difficulties?

392
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,145
2012? Yes! You mean the differences

393
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:45,575
in 2004, right?

394
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,495
No, no, Not the differences.

395
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:52,005
You said that you went in 2012 just

396
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,615
to visit and you ended up staying

397
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:57,255
here after. How was it during that time?

398
00:19:57,255 --> 00:20:00,755
Living here is different. Visiting is

399
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,985
different too.

400
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,755
Living here is very difficult. You really

401
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,605
have to have a good job to live here.

402
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:13,575
And... when you decided that I visited

403
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:16,575
and now I want to live here, did anyone

404
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,965
help you with where to live?

405
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,915
Or how to find a job?

406
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:27,015
No! How to help? I stayed in Echmiadzin.

407
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:30,675
The people were really great. I have had

408
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:34,535
neighbours... as soon as I moved to

409
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:37,175
a house, they always came to ask

410
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:38,725
if I needed anything.

411
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,215
If I said, yes, I need something.

412
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:44,885
They have offered pots, pans, blankets,

413
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,355
pillows, and clothing.

414
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,355
If I said, yes, I need something.

415
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,715
I would most probably have rooms

416
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,475
full of pots and pans and blankets.

417
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,705
The community always offered to help.

418
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,965
We were always treated well.

419
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,475
[Children yelling in background] 
Children? Yes!

420
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:05,375
I have received help from Mission

421
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,565
Armenia, and they helped pay my rent.

422
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,445
I have also received books

423
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:14,795
from the Red Cross (and that is

424
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,805
worth mentioning as well).

425
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,355
There is another organization

426
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:25,385
called UN in English.

427
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:29,065
They are always willing and continue to

428
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:32,525
help us. We also have Syrian centers

429
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,733
called ACMA. They distribute

430
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,923
nutrients/food every 3-4 months.

431
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,993
One of the charities helps us find

432
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:45,663
doctors. We get help from Syrian doctors,

433
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:49,713
and they take care of us without pay.

434
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:52,903
The government has made education free.

435
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:55,973
Going to the polyclinic is also free.

436
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,153
The government tries to help us

437
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,233
as much as possible.

438
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:04,233
And... the first time in Armenia...

439
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,953
not the first time but the second time...

440
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,933
did you work during that time? Where?

441
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,893
Here! Here, I taught people at home.

442
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:17,213
Taught! That is how they say it in Eastern

443
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:20,223
Armenian. So, I did one-on-one

444
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,373
sessions with kids.

445
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:25,533
In that way, I was able to make a living.

446
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,923
Second? The third time?

447
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,983
No! When I came here the last time,

448
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,333
I did one-on-one sessions. When I

449
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,453
came here to visit, no,

450
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:38,283
I just came to visit.

451
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:45,493
In 2014, the third time that you came,

452
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:51,773
where did you live? Or now, where do you live?

453
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:54,273
I lived mostly in Etchmiadzin

454
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,483
and then came to Yerevan. They paid

455
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:59,593
the rent. When they stopped, I could

456
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:02,373
no longer continue to pay the rent.

457
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:06,483
It is hard to survive in Yerevan. I went

458
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:09,833
back to Etchmiadzin. And there,

459
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,413
Mission Armenia helped me

460
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:14,933
again. UN paid my rent.

461
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:19,063
After that, my dream was to live

462
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,733
in Yerevan. There are more job

463
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,963
opportunities in Yerevan.

464
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:28,509
I applied to UN and Mission Armenia,

465
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,423
and they helped me find a boarding room.

466
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,853
I have been living there for a year and a half now.

467
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:39,243
And... do you live here

468
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:43,533
and work with Mission Armenia?

469
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:50,473
I take part in trainings. I teach kids.

470
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,873
I give English classes

471
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,703
and sometimes Armenian.

472
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,993
Because... learning from Western to

473
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:05,433
Eastern Armenian is very easy. It is

474
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:09,113
much easier. The grammar and spelling

475
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:12,203
and etcetera are much easier.

476
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:15,801
And... how is life at the new house?

477
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:20,752
How is life there? I live in a unit

478
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:24,383
that has 5 boarding rooms.

479
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:29,014
We all live in the same unit.

480
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,557
The only problem is during winter

481
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,113
we had heating problems.

482
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:38,933
Last year! Last year, we did not have

483
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,973
a bathroom to take a shower in

484
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:44,433
or could not even do laundry. We were

485
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,143
not living in good conditions. As soon as

486
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:50,053
a drop of water would drip on the floor...

487
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,908
it was scary even the elderly could

488
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:58,413
have slipped. UN paid for the rent

489
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,243
and renovations of this housing unit.

490
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:05,593
Some renovations were done, but some have

491
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:11,523
not been completed and I do not know why.

492
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:14,323
Heating is an important issue

493
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:15,323
in the winter.

494
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:19,033
We really need it, but who is going to

495
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,083
help us and how I do not know.

496
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,263
How do you think the government

497
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:26,703
and the other organizations are going

498
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,933
to help Syrian-Armenians to have

499
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,403
a better and easier life here?

500
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:36,813
The government does all that it can.

501
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:43,563
They can only help within their limits.

502
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:46,903
The organizations and benefactors of other

503
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:50,423
foreign countries can help us more

504
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,152
effectively if it is well-coordinated

505
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,663
with local authorities.

506
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,163
Which organization and in what way...

507
00:25:58,163 --> 00:26:00,783
that only they know.

508
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:04,783
I think that the organizations can help us

509
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:08,513
more, but they have already helped us

510
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,543
(like UN and the Red Cross).

511
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:13,573
They have already done that.

512
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:20,003
And... did you feel welcomed by

513
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:23,433
the Armenians living in Armenia?

514
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,213
Did you feel welcome and see any

515
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:29,293
differences in the culture?

516
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:33,933
On the contrary, I was emotionally ready

517
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,603
to live here from way before.

518
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:40,383
The Armenia population is not that

519
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:42,933
different compared to Syrian-Armenians.

520
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,413
They have been to and visited Aleppo

521
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:49,463
already. We are not foreigners. For us,

522
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:53,643
the Armenian culture is not different.

523
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:56,193
There can be some small differences.

524
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:58,823
The country the Diasporan

525
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:01,793
is from can have an effect on him/her.

526
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:05,173
Here, it is a purely Armenian culture.

527
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:09,293
Everything is very beautiful and nice.

528
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:12,383
There is not that much difference. I got

529
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:16,603
used to it quickly. I accepted them in

530
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:21,113
every way from their cuisine to their way

531
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:25,223
of thinking. It was not that difficult.

532
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:28,123
With those little cultural and language

533
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:30,443
differences, how do you keep your

534
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:33,983
Syrian-Armenian culture here in Armenia?

535
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:36,983
For the Syrian culture, first is

536
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:39,983
Western Armenian. I do not want to forget

537
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:43,053
Western Armenian. I want to pronounce

538
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,663
Eastern Armenian well, but I cannot.

539
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,623
I can talk (said in Western).

540
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,833
I can talk (said in Eastern).

541
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,913
Pronouncing it is difficult.

542
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:53,773
Unfortunately, we have lost

543
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,893
the traditional pronunciations.

544
00:27:55,893 --> 00:28:03,843
As a Syrian culture, an Armenian

545
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:08,003
culture, a Syrian-Armenian culture,

546
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:11,143
we still have the same traditions and

547
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:14,943
continue to do things in the same way.

548
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,723
Do you still think that you live

549
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:23,033
in your homeland? This is not the same

550
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:25,933
homeland that your grandfathers

551
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:29,003
and grandmothers lived in? Do you still

552
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,173
feel that this is your homeland?

553
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:33,713
Of course, it is not the same. 100 years

554
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,443
ago, it was different. It is not about

555
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,813
the 100 years. Already 5 years ago,

556
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,488
Armenia was different. Life is more

557
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:45,813
difficult now. When I came as a tourist

558
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:49,933
just to visit, my point of view

559
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,353
was different. Now that I live here,

560
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:55,243
it is more difficult. I saw more

561
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:58,463
of the difficulties. It is mine

562
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:01,283
and I belong to it. The sense of

563
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:05,043
belongingness is very nice. All Armenians

564
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,533
have to put their roots in Armenia.

565
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:11,493
Every person has to put their roots in

566
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:12,793
their own land.

567
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,073
When on someone else's land you plant

568
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:19,173
a tree, you might not have the time to sit

569
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:22,493
under the tree's shadow. You have to plant

570
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,973
the tree on your own land.

571
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,403
Do you want to stay here? Or go back

572
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:31,813
to Aleppo? Or go somewhere else?

573
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,743
I want to go back to Aleppo, because

574
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:38,713
I miss the land that I grew up in

575
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,983
(my birthplace, my home, and my neighborhood).

576
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:45,893
I have lived there for 46 years before

577
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:49,053
coming here. Of course, I have a lot of

578
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:53,633
memories there and I miss everyone there,

579
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:57,293
but I want to continue to live in Armenia.

580
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:01,713
And... what do you want to do for work?

581
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:06,333
On my own? On my own! If I do not find

582
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:10,603
a good job, there is no hope.

583
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:14,603
There has to be a job out there.

584
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:18,603
You should not lose all hope.

585
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:22,463
To enjoy life, you have to create your own

586
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:27,143
aspirations. Without work, you cannot

587
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:29,433
do anything.

588
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,633
What kind of job do you want?

589
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,423
Whatever is available. This is Armenia.

590
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:36,693
You have to work with whatever work

591
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:38,233
is available.

592
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,773
You said that you do not have family in Aleppo.

593
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:43,323
No, I do not have family there.

594
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:45,383
Do you have any family there?

595
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:46,853
No, no family.

596
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:49,643
Yes, I have friends and neighbours there.

597
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,933
Are they still there?

598
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,323
For the most part, they went to Europe.

599
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:57,423
For the most part, no one is there now.

600
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,443
Is your house still there? Yes, it is.

601
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:04,173
Is anyone checking up on it? Yes!

602
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:13,562
In 1915, we had to... no... we were forced

603
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:16,722
to leave. We did not decide to leave.

604
00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:20,292
Unfortunately, our forefathers were

605
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,452
all displaced in 1915.

606
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:27,092
From the war, the ruins, and the death

607
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,932
of many people, only a few of the families

608
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,592
made it to Syrian land.

609
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:36,592
Now, it is very different. No one told us

610
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:41,222
to leave Syria. Never. We left. There are

611
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:44,592
still a lot of Armenians that live in

612
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:48,592
Aleppo, Syria. We left. We had the ability

613
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:51,992
to leave. We had the convenience to

614
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:55,012
leave. We wanted to leave. From the people

615
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,002
that came to Armenia with us, they came

616
00:31:58,002 --> 00:32:00,992
here temporarily. We thought the war

617
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:03,452
would end and we would go back.

618
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:05,892
That is the reason why we came here.

619
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,122
Now, I do not want to talk for other

620
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:11,142
people. For the most part, the people

621
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:14,952
that have work here do not go back.

622
00:32:14,952 --> 00:32:18,842
When they have learned and gotten used to

623
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:21,682
the life here and have a job here,

624
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:24,122
I do not think that they will go back.

625
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:26,662
I highly doubt that Aleppo will go back

626
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:29,072
to the way it was. It will take a long

627
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,512
time for it to be the same as before.

628
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:35,452
It will take a long time.

629
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:42,048
And... for you, personally, what draws you to Armenia?

630
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:45,662
Personally! Since childhood, the love

631
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:49,812
for Armenia was in our house, at school,

632
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:53,212
and in the community centers. There is

633
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:56,072
a problem of keeping our Armenianhood.

634
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:58,282
The community centers and the schools

635
00:32:58,282 --> 00:33:02,092
work with this issue. In our house,

636
00:33:02,092 --> 00:33:08,702
patriotism was important. They always

637
00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:11,322
mentioned Armenia. When I came

638
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:16,062
to Armenia in 2004 for 1 month,

639
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:19,302
I left my soul here.

640
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:23,552
I wanted to live here, but we could not

641
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:27,552
dare to do that because of work. We could

642
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:32,052
not destroy everything there and start

643
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,442
a new life here. We did not know if

644
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:37,072
we would succeed or not. I already

645
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:40,082
wanted to live in Armenia. And now,

646
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:42,782
I am here.

647
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:44,212
Very good!

648
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:50,172
What advice would you give? To give advice

649
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:53,542
to who? To Syrian-Armenians?

650
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,562
Yes, the ones that returned to Armenia.

651
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,042
I do not give myself permission to give

652
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:02,782
advice to others, because every

653
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:08,992
difficulty and experience in life teaches

654
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:12,042
you something new. You will see that

655
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,782
there is still a lot that you do not know.

656
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:16,952
For this reason, I cannot give advice

657
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:19,592
to anybody. Everyone will know what is

658
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,482
convenient for them and will think before

659
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:26,632
taking the appropriate steps. Like I said

660
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:31,592
before, for everyone their motherland

661
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:37,842
has to be their inspiring, final

662
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:42,342
destination that they will feel

663
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:45,442
comfortable in.

664
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:48,892
We do not need to live in foreign lands.

665
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:52,332
You always have to live on your own land.

666
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:55,712
The next generation... you will teach

667
00:34:55,712 --> 00:35:00,732
the next generation about their own land.

668
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,902
The tree that I talked about earlier,

669
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,002
you are going to plant it on

670
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:08,402
your motherland. That is a beautiful

671
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:10,192
statement.

672
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:15,942
Can you tell me about yourself

673
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:19,662
in two words? About myself?

674
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:22,192
What are those two words?

675
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:25,872
I am proud that I am Armenian. I am still

676
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:28,772
having some difficulties and do not know

677
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:31,282
what the future will bring, but I am happy

678
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,482
that I live in Armenia. I always wanted to

679
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,992
live here.

680
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:39,192
I am thankful to the Armenian people

681
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:42,222
here that were always ready to help.

682
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:51,322
How can Syrian-Armenians help Armenia?

683
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:56,422
Every person that has a talent or can

684
00:35:56,422 --> 00:36:00,793
bring something new to the table

685
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:04,197
or has a skill, depending on

686
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:07,982
the conditions, he/she can help

687
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:11,532
Armenia. Why not? It depends if

688
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,022
he/she has the right conditions.

689
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,592
He/she has to be given the opportunity.

690
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,792
The conditions have to be met

691
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,112
financially first.

692
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:23,672
You can work with things you know, so that

693
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:27,522
you can help others as well. If someone

694
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:32,872
has a personal store, he/she is not going

695
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:36,012
to work alone. That individual will have

696
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,902
other employees. Other families will be

697
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,902
able to benefit from them too. This is

698
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,092
the smallest way that they can help.

699
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:45,472
There are other ways too. They can

700
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:48,502
be artists or artisans for example.

701
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:54,222
Syrian-Armenians have some advanced

702
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:57,602
and knowledgeable workers now that work

703
00:36:57,602 --> 00:37:02,082
in different centers like the national

704
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:04,802
library and other places that

705
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,512
I do not want to specify.

706
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:09,442
There are already Syrian-Armenians that

707
00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:12,872
are working and are helping Armenia.

708
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:20,252
And... how did you make friends and make

709
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:25,232
a community here? New social life?

710
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,292
With Syrian-Armenians or Armenians from Armenia?

711
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,172
My surroundings are mostly

712
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:33,032
Eastern Armenians. I like change. I was

713
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:35,492
emotionally ready to accept all

714
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:41,142
the changes. Their life is interesting.

715
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,892
It was not difficult to get used to

716
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:47,292
the change. For me, it was nice.

717
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:50,752
I have many vast, rich,

718
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:52,982
and interesting surroundings.

719
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:55,779
What are? You were so happy when you

720
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:58,172
were saying Armenia has welcomed you

721
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:00,028
and maybe you have said it already, but

722
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,772
what are some examples of how

723
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:02,712
they welcomed you?

724
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:04,202
How Armenia has welcomed you?

725
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:06,542
How the Armenians were accepting

726
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:09,142
of us here? Example? Do you have

727
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:10,842
examples? How they welcomed us?

728
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:13,582
Like I said before... how the people?

729
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,622
Do you have stories or examples?

730
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,732
For example, it has happened that I have

731
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,582
been in some sort of transportation

732
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:22,422
and had to go somewhere

733
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:23,992
and they knew from the way

734
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,262
I talked that I spoke Western Armenian

735
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,112
and they have paid 100 AMD for me.

736
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:33,822
They wanted to do something. It has

737
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:37,752
happened that they did not take 100 AMD

738
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:43,382
from me or the taxi charged me less.

739
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:46,652
All these people are people I do not know.

740
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:50,222
Speaking about neighbours, as soon as

741
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,942
I would move...

742
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:55,292
they would ask me what I need.

743
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,862
With that question, you know that you are

744
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:02,272
not alone. There have always been people

745
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,162
who were willing to help us. It was not

746
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:08,312
only me. There have always been people

747
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,402
and institutions who wanted to help

748
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:13,932
(like the Red Cross, UN,

749
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:17,332
and Mission Armenia). They are

750
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:21,202
non-Syrian organizations. They already

751
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:24,712
help us. There are a lot of people here

752
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:26,662
that want to help us.

753
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:29,052
Is there anything you want to add that

754
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:30,702
you did not say?

755
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,902
There is a lot.

756
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:37,712
What kind of thing?

757
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,992
All the Armenians should come back to Armenia.

758
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:43,812
Please see, for example, my family has

759
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:47,162
always loved Armenia even before

760
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:49,912
seeing it. I already loved Armenia. When

761
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:52,872
we saw Armenia, we fell in love with it...

762
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:55,262
because you feel like you belong to it

763
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,452
and it belongs to you and is your mom.

764
00:39:57,452 --> 00:40:00,812
With all its bad qualities, it is yours

765
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:03,862
and you belong to it. We really wanted

766
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,002
to come and move here. Since we always

767
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:09,912
thought about our work situation, we did

768
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:12,412
not take the necessary steps to move here.

769
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,962
You can see that the day came and that we

770
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,332
are here now. We should not have come in

771
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,602
this way. We should have been more

772
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,962
organized when we came here. In the end,

773
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,272
we heard that our place is our mother's

774
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:30,842
lap and not foreign lands. Syria,

775
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:33,992
my birthplace, is a very good place

776
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:38,232
in terms of its people and its government.

777
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,772
They are like family to us.

778
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,582
Your motherland should be your country.

779
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:48,092
All the Armenians, especially those that

780
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,762
had the convenience to work here, can

781
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:55,302
create jobs. They do not have to think.

782
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,942
There is not that much to think about.

783
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:01,342
They have to come and start from here

784
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:04,422
and after them the next generation.

785
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:08,159
When the Diasporans start to come

786
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,719
to Armenia, especially the youth, they

787
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,482
should not be easily discouraged and have

788
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:20,052
high hopes. You should create that hope.

789
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:22,422
From generation to generation, we get

790
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:26,732
better. We sit and watch the Diasporans

791
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,592
from afar. The love of Armenia is

792
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:32,692
not enough. We have to do something.

793
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:36,865
Everyone should do, whatever they can do.

794
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:39,412
There is a short story.

795
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:44,092
In the forest, a fire takes place.

796
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:47,202
All the animals... what does that word

797
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:51,202
mean? Fire! All the animals think about

798
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:54,942
saving their souls and run away. All

799
00:41:54,942 --> 00:42:01,252
of a sudden, they see a bird on its back

800
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,592
and its feet up. They ask the bird, what

801
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:07,412
are you doing? Run away and save your

802
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:10,152
soul. You can get burnt and die. The bird

803
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,885
says, no, I am holding up the sky.

804
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:17,615
So, that bird with its small and weak feet

805
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:20,255
is trying to do its part.

806
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:25,855
It holds up the sky to protect and save

807
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:28,565
the forest. Sorry, it was not fire.

808
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:30,295
You could say that it was the end

809
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:31,547
of the world.

810
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:34,745
If everyone does what they

811
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,975
can like the bird in the story and does

812
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,345
not get discouraged, something will

813
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:44,035
happen. So, we can do something to help.

814
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:49,285
Anything else?

815
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:52,525
No, that is all. I am a teacher I can

816
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:55,045
talk all morning.

817
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:57,000
We learned a lot from you.
